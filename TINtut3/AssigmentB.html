The first film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, closely follows the storyline from the Mirage comic books,
in addition to some of the more lighthearted elements of the cartoons. The film tells the origin story of Splinter and the Turtles,
their initial encounters with April O'Neil (Judith Hoag) and Casey Jones (Elias Koteas), and their first confrontation with The Shredder
and his Foot Clan.
