<h1> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles </h1>

<p> <strong>The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles </strong> 
<b>(often shortened to the TMNT or Ninja Turtles)</b>
 are four fictional teenaged superhero anthropomorphic mutant turtles.
 Named after Italian Renaissance artists,
 they were trained by their anthropomorphic rat sensei in the Japanese martial art of ninjutsu.
 From their home in the sewers of New York City, they battle petty criminals, evil overlords,
 mutated creatures, and alien invaders while attempting to remain hidden from society.
 They were created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird.
 <mark>The characters originated in comic books published
 by Mirage Studios and expanded into cartoon series, films, video games, toys, and other merchandise.
 During the peak of the franchise's popularity in the late 1980s and early 1990s,
 it gained worldwide success and fame.</mark> </p>
 
 <h2> History </h2>
 <p2> <strong> The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles first appeared in an American comic book 
 published by Mirage Studios in 1984 in Dover, New Hampshire.</strong> 
 The concept arose from
 a humorous drawing sketched out by Eastman during a casual evening of brainstorming and
 bad television with Laird. Using money from a tax refund, together with a loan from Eastman's 
 uncle, the young artists self-published a single-issue comic intended to parody four of the most
 popular comics of the early 1980s: Marvel Comics’ Daredevil and New Mutants, Dave Sim’s Cerebus, 
 and Frank Miller’s Ronin.<mark> The TMNT comic
 book series has been published in various incarnations by various
 comic book companies since 1984. </mark>
