<h1 class = "header1"> CULTURE </h1>

<div class="boxed" align = center>
<p class = "p1">The culture of Japan has changed greatly over the millennia,
 from the country's prehistoric Jōmon Period, to its contemporary modern culture,
 which absorbs influences from Asia and other regions of the world.[1]
Japan's indigenous culture originates primarily from the Yayoi people
 who settled in Japan between 1000 BCE and 300 CE. Yayoi culture spread
 to the main island of Honshū, mixing with the native Jōmon culture.[2]
 Modern Japanese have an estimated 80% Yayoi and 20% Jōmon ancestry.[3]
Japanese culture was influenced from ancient times
 to the Middle Ages primarily by multiple Chinese 
 dynasties and to a lesser extent by other Asian countries.
 For example the Japanese language uses Chinese characters (kanji)
 for writing, but Japanese has no genetic relationship with Chinese.[4]
 Since the Meiji period Japan has been primarily influenced by western countries.

<h1 class = "header1"> LANGUAGE </h1>

<div class="boxed" align = center>
<p class = "p1">Japanese is the official and primary language of Japan.
 Japanese has a lexically distinct pitch-accent system.
 Early Japanese is known largely on the basis of its state in the 8th century,
 when the three major works of Old Japanese were compiled.
 The earliest attestation of the Japanese language is in a Chinese document
 from 256 AD. The Japanese language has no genetic relationship with Chinese,
 [4] belonging instead to a completely different family of languages known as the
 Japonic languages.
Japanese is written with a combination of three scripts:
 kanji, hiragana and katakana. Chinese characters, or kanji
 (漢字), are extensively used in Japanese writing as non-phonetic
 ideograms, imported from China to Japan in 50 AD; before that time,
 Japan had no system of writing. In the present day, there are a notable 
 number[clarification needed] of kanji in modern Japanese with a different
 meaning from the corresponding hanzi character used in modern Chinese.
 Modern Japanese also features far fewer simplified Chinese characters
 in comparison to modern Chinese; Japanese people typically use fewer kanji 
 in general and use them mainly for nouns, adjective stems and verb stems.
Both hiragana and katakana are phonetic syllabaries derived from the Chinese man'yōgana of the 5th century.[7] Hiragana and katakana were developed from simplified kanji; hiragana emerged somewhere around the 9th century[8] and was mainly used by women for informal language, with katakana mainly used by men for formal language. By the 10th century, both were commonly used by everyone.[9]

The Latin alphabet is often used in modern Japanese, especially for company names and logos, advertising, and when inputting Japanese into a computer. The Hindu-Arabic numerals are generally used for numbers, but traditional Sino-Japanese numerals are common.

<h1 class = "header1"> RELIGION</h1>

<div class="boxed" align = center>
<p class = "p1">Shinto and Buddhism 
are the primary religions of Japan,
 though a secular Christmas is widely celebrated,
 and minority Christian and Islamic communities exist.
Shinto
Main article: Shinto
Shinto is an ethnic religion focusing on ceremonies and rituals.
 In Shinto, followers believe that kami – Shinto deities or spirits
 – are present throughout nature, including rocks, trees, and mountains.
 Humans can also be considered to possess a kami. One of the goals of Shinto
 is to maintain a connection between humans, nature, and kami. The religion 
 developed in Japan prior to the sixth century CE, after which point followers
 built shrines to worship kami.[10]

<h1 class = "header1"> NATIONAL CHARACTER</h1>

<div class="boxed" align = center>
<p class = "p1">The Japanese "national character" has been written about 
under the term Nihonjinron, literally meaning "theories/discussions about
 the Japanese people" and referring to texts on matters that are normally 
 the concerns of sociology, psychology, history, linguistics, and philosophy,
 but emphasizing the authors' assumptions or perceptions of 
 Japanese exceptionalism; these are predominantly written in Japan by Japanese
 people,[11] though noted examples have also been written by foreign residents,
 journalists and even scholars.

<h1 class = "header1"> LITERATURE</h1>

<div class="boxed" align = center>
<p class = "p1">Early works of Japanese literature were heavily influenced by
 cultural contact with China and Chinese literature, often written in Classical
 Chinese. Eventually, Japanese literature developed into a separate style in its
 own right as Japanese writers began writing their own works about Japan. 
 The Tale of Genji, written by Murasaki Shikibu during the Heian period, 
 is known worldwide as a unique Japanese literature. Since Japan reopened
 its ports to Western trading and diplomacy in the 19th century, Western
 and Eastern literature have strongly affected each other and continue to do so.

<h1 class = "header1"> TRADITIONAL CLOTHING</h1>

<div class="boxed" align = center>
<p class = "p1">The kimono is the national garment of Japan,
 having developed from Chinese court clothing in the Nara period
 (Tang dynasty China) following the exchange of diplomatic envoys between 
 the two countries at that time. The word "kimono" translates literally as 
 "thing to wear on the shoulders"; however, this term developed some time 
 around the Edo period, before which most kimono-like garments were referred 
 to as "kosode" (lit., "short sleeve"), with longer-sleeved garments being known
 as "furisode" (lit., "swinging sleeve").

The earliest versions of the kimono were heavily influenced by traditional 
Chinese clothing, known today as hanfu (kanfuku (漢服) in Japanese). This
 influence was spread through Japanese envoy missions to China, resulting 
 in extensive Chinese cultural adoption by Japan as early as the 5th century AD.
 [13] It was during the 8th century, however, that Chinese fashions came fully
 into style, and following the cancellation of the 20th mission to Tang dynasty
 China, these fashions developed independently, with the overlapping, V-shaped
 collar becoming women's fashion and the precusor to the modern kimono.[13]

Kimono, alongside all other items of traditional Japanese clothing,
 are known collectively as "wafuku", meaning "Japanese clothing", as
 opposed to "yofuku", Western-style clothing. Kimono come in a variety
 of colors, styles, and sizes. Men mainly wear darker or more muted colors,
 while women tend to wear brighter colors and pastels, and, especially
 for younger women, often with complicated abstract or floral patterns.

She wears a traditional hairstyle and a diagonal sash that reads "Women's Suffrage Party" in English. Behind her, a crowd of American men look on.

In previous decades, married women wore short sleeved kimono, whereas unmarried women wore long sleeved kimono to both formal and informal occasions; however, the rise in both the average age of marriage and the numbers of women never marrying in Japan has led to the divide between sleeve length becoming one more of age, with most women in their early twenties wearing long sleeved kimono only to formal occasions, and most women past their early twenties wearing short sleeved kimono to formal events. Other developments include the abandoning of layered kimono and the standardisation of the length of short sleeved women's kimono to a range of roughly 49 centimetres (19 in) to 52 centimetres (20 in) in length, both developments driven by fabric shortages in WW2.

The happi coat is another form of traditional clothing. A happi (commonly Westernised as "happy") coat is a straight sleeved coat typically decorated with a family crest and/or kanji along the collar. In previous centuries, happi were commonly worn by firefighters; the coats would be constructed from several layers of heavy cotton stitched together, and would be soaked in water to provide protection from fire.

Alongside traditional clothing, Japan also has distinct footwear; 
tabi, ankle-length split-toed socks, are commonly worn with the
 kimono, and are designed to be worn with traditional shoes such
 as geta and zōri. Geta are thonged sandals mounted on wooden blocks 
 extending from the base of the shoe to the floor, and are worn by men 
 and women with kimono or yukata; zōri are flat base or sloping sandals
 made of a number of different materials, and are considered to be more
 formal than geta.
